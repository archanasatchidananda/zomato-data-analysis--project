## Introduction
Zomato Restaurant Analysis project initiative dives deep into Zomato's rich dataset to uncover meaningful insights about customer behavior and restaurant performance. Leveraging advanced data analytics and visualization tools, this project aims to identify key performance indicators (KPIs), highlight actionable trends, and deliver valuable conclusions that can drive strategic decisions within the food and service industry.

Through meticulous data analysis, you’ll explore customer preferences, restaurant ratings, and market opportunities. Interactive dashboards created with Tableau and Power BI will transform raw data into clear, actionable insights, empowering users to understand and capitalize on the dynamics of this competitive sector.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

This project involves analyzing Zomato's restaurant and customer data to derive insights through the following KPIs:


 - Calculate the number of restaurants based on city and country.
 - Determine the number of restaurants opening by year, quarter, and month.
 - Count the number of restaurants grouped by average ratings.   
 - Create reasonable price buckets based on average price and calculate how many restaurants fall into each bucket.
 - Calculate the percentage of restaurants offering table booking.
 - Calculate the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.
 - Develop charts to explore the distribution of cuisines, ratings, and restaurant trends by city.
 - Introduce new KPIs based on data analysis and create meaningful visualizations for them.

## Analysis Details

1. **Average Cost Analysis:**

   The dataset reveals significant disparities in the average meal costs across different countries. Notably, Singapore and the Philippines stand out with markedly higher average costs of two —155.8 USD and 117.3 USD respectively—suggesting that these markets might face higher operating expenses, premium pricing strategies, or elevated cost structures overall. In contrast, countries such as Sri Lanka, India, and Turkey exhibit considerably lower costs, with average costs of two of 8.1 USD, 7.5 USD, and 4.2 USD respectively. These figures reflect the varying economic contexts and consumer purchasing power across regions.

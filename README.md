## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

This project involves analyzing Zomato's restaurant and customer data to derive insights through the following KPIs:


 - Calculate the number of restaurants based on city and country.
 - Determine the number of restaurants opening by year, quarter, and month.
 - Count the number of restaurants grouped by average ratings.   
 - Create reasonable price buckets based on average price and calculate how many restaurants fall into each bucket.
 - Calculate the percentage of restaurants offering table booking.
 - Calculate the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.
 - Develop charts to explore the distribution of cuisines, ratings, and restaurant trends by city.
 - Introduce new KPIs based on data analysis and create meaningful visualizations for them.

## Analysis Details

1. **Average Cost Analysis:**

   The dataset reveals significant disparities in the average meal costs across different countries. Notably, Singapore and the Philippines stand out with markedly higher average costs of two —155.8 USD and 117.3 USD respectively—suggesting that these markets might face higher operating expenses, premium pricing strategies, or elevated cost structures overall. In contrast, countries such as Sri Lanka, India, and Turkey exhibit considerably lower costs, with average costs of two of 8.1 USD, 7.5 USD, and 4.2 USD respectively. These figures reflect the varying economic contexts and consumer purchasing power across regions.
   
3. **Restaurant Count Analysis**

   India leads robustly with 8,652 restaurants, underscoring deep market penetration and fierce competition, while the United States holds a moderate position with 434 establishments; niche markets such as Sri Lanka, Qatar, and Singapore each have 20 restaurants—a figure that may either indicate early digital adoption or a targeted market segment—and Canada, with its very low count of 4, suggests potential data gaps or an underdeveloped sector.

    Complementing these geographic insights, our trend analysis shows that the annual number of new restaurant openings has fluctuated over the years, with notable peaks in 2011 and 2018 registering 1,089 and 1,102 openings respectively, highlighting cyclical bursts of market expansion driven by economic factors or promotional cycles

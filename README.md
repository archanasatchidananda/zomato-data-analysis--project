## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

This project involves analyzing Zomato's restaurant and customer data to derive insights through the following KPIs:


 - Calculate the number of restaurants based on city and country.
 - Determine the number of restaurants opening by year, quarter, and month.
 - Count the number of restaurants grouped by average ratings.   
 - Create reasonable price buckets based on average price and calculate how many restaurants fall into each bucket.
 - Calculate the percentage of restaurants offering table booking.
 - Calculate the percentage of restaurants offering online delivery.
 - Develop charts to explore the distribution of cuisines, ratings, and restaurant trends by city.
 - Introduce new KPIs based on data analysis and create meaningful visualizations for them.

## Analysis Details

1. **Average Cost Analysis:**

   The dataset reveals significant disparities in the average meal costs across different countries. Notably, Singapore and the Philippines stand out with markedly higher average costs of two —155.8 USD and 117.3 USD respectively—suggesting that these markets might face higher operating expenses, premium pricing strategies, or elevated cost structures overall. In contrast, countries such as Sri Lanka, India, and Turkey exhibit considerably lower costs, with average costs of two of 8.1 USD, 7.5 USD, and 4.2 USD respectively. These figures reflect the varying economic contexts and consumer purchasing power across regions.
   
3. **Restaurant Count Analysis**

   India leads robustly with 8,652 restaurants, underscoring deep market penetration and fierce competition, while the United States holds a moderate position with 434 establishments; niche markets such as Qatar, and Singapore each have 20 restaurants—a figure that may either indicate early digital adoption or a targeted market segment—and Canada, with its very low count of 4, suggests potential data gaps or an underdeveloped sector.

   Notably, a deeper dive into India's urban landscape shows a concentrated culinary ecosystem in the National Capital Region—New Delhi accounts for 575 restaurants, yet its neighboring cities exhibit even higher numbers, with Gurgaon reporting 1,118, Noida 1,099, Faridabad 521, and Ghaziabad only 52—indicating that while New Delhi serves as a pivotal hub, surrounding cities contribute substantially to the overall density, thereby offering unique insights into regional market dynamics and strategic opportunities for targeted growth initiatives.

    Complementing these geographic insights, our trend analysis shows that the annual number of new restaurant openings has fluctuated over the years, with notable peaks in 2011 and 2018 registering 1,089 and 1,102 openings respectively, highlighting cyclical bursts of market expansion driven by economic factors or promotional cycles.

5. **Service Availability Analysis**

   Only 28% of restaurants provide online delivery services, catering primarily to convenience-oriented customers, a mere 13% offer table booking, reflecting limited support for planned dining experiences. Among these, 435 establishments stand out for integrating both services, showcasing their strategic adaptability to meet diverse consumer demands. This gap in service offerings signifies an untapped opportunity for broader industry innovation, emphasizing the need for a balanced approach to enhance customer engagement and satisfaction across delivery and dine-in preferences.

6. **Popularity Analysis**

    The growing popularity of North Indian cuisine, often fused with Mughlai and Chinese flavors, highlights a significant trend in multi-cuisine offerings that cater to evolving consumer preferences. Fusion menus are particularly appealing in urban markets, offering both variety and unique dining experiences. This trend presents strategic opportunities for restaurants to innovate through creative combinations and signature dishes.

7. **Ratings and Review Analysis**
   
    The most restaurants (4,388) fall into the 3-4 rating range, indicating good customer satisfaction, while 1,114 restaurants stand out with excellent ratings of 4-5. A smaller portion (2,148) is rated below 1, signaling areas for improvement in service or quality.This distribution, based on 9,551 restaurants, highlights significant room for growth while also emphasizing the strength of well-rated establishments.
   

## Conclusion

Zomato's growth can be enhanced by expanding online delivery and table booking services, targeting high-density markets like NCR in India, and optimizing pricing in premium regions such as Singapore. Embracing fusion cuisine trends like North Indian-Mughlai-Chinese combinations, improving low-rated restaurant performance, and leveraging social media can boost customer engagement. Strategic initiatives like AI-driven personalization, loyalty programs, cloud kitchens, sustainability practices, and global expansion, coupled with advanced analytics and community engagement, will position Zomato for sustained success in the competitive food-tech industry.
